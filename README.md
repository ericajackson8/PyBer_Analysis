# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
As a new Pyber Analyst, I was tasked with the assignment of analysing the Pyber ridesharing data in three of the existing markets.  Because these three markets are vastly different city types (Suburburban, Urban, and Rural); I will complete a comprehensive exploration to identify the relationship between the city type, driver and rider stats, and specific KPIs.

## Analysis Results
Rural cities had the lowest total fares across all months; while Urban cities had the largest total fares. Rural cities also have the lowest number of total drivers which means that they will have less rides overall, and rural drivers will make more money.  There are several factors that could be contributing to this shortage of drivers and increase cost of the ride-sharing service in Rural areas.  One obvious factor to increase cost is the distance, rural areas tend to have a greate distance betwen locations and so the cost for using the ride-sharing service becomes insurmountable for potential customers and potential drivers.  Drivers may have to drive far just to pick-up a fare and then drive to take them to their destination.
## Analysis Summary
 - To get a better understanding of some of the Rural challenges, I would recommend a deep-dive analysis and possible a customer survey to better understand the customer needs and satisfaction with existing ride-sharing services.
